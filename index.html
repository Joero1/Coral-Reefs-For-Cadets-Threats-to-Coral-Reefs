  <h2>Rising Ocean Temperature</h2>
<p>The ocean surface temperature has been rising by an average of about 0.11 degrees Celsius each decade since the 1970s. This may not sound like a huge amount but marine life has evolved for generally highly stable conditions so even a change of a small percentage can have a substantial effect. The temperature rise is due to an increase in greenhouse gases emissions (particularly carbon dioxide and methane), that increases the amount of heat from the sun that is trapped on Earth.</p> 
      <p>The biggest threat to coral reefs caused by climate change is an increase in coral bleaching (see below). Other effects include an increase in damage caused by weather disturbances, and a shift in distribution of species, as their region of suitable temperature shifts. For example, the oceans are seeing a spread of tropical jellyfish into more northern regions</p>

<h2>Ocean Acidification</h2>
<p>About 25% of carbon dioxide emissions dissolve into the ocean and becomes carbonic acid. This means that as the levels of atmospheric CO2 has increased, so has the concentration of carbonic acid in the ocean. One of the biggest detriments of this is this is that it makes it harder for organisms to produce calcium carbonate. This includes the production of shells for crustaceans and snails, and crucially the weakening and therefore increased death rate of coral. The oceans are currently 0.1 pH units lower (i.e. more acidic) than any other time in the last 420 thousand years. It is at risk of dropping by another 0.4 pH units by the end of the century.</p>

<h2>Overfishing</h2>
<p>Sustainable fishing means fishing at a rate that will ensure there is enough for future generations. Overfishing is fishing at a rate that exceeds this. At the moment, the area allowed for fishing on coral reefs is more than 60% higher than is sustainable. A reduction of fish has many knock-on effects, including a reduction in food for species that prey on them (including humans) as well as an increase in algal growth that is not being grazed and is therefore likely to outcompete coral. There are a few particularly destruction methods of fishing that still take place.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Trawler fishing</strong><br> 
Trawler fishing consists of dragging an enormous net from a boat across the sea floor to obtain a particularly large catch of fish. This can do a huge amount of damage to the seafloor and will also ensnare whatever is in the path of the net, including sharks and marine mammals.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Blast fishing</strong><br> 
Also called ‘dynamite fishing’, blast fishing is the act of unleashing a stick of dynamite in the water to emit a blast that erupts the swim bladders of nearby fish, thus causing them to rise to the surface for an easy catch. Blast fishing will also destroy many decades worth of coral growth that is caught in the blast radius.</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Cyanide fishing</strong><br> 
Cyanide fishing is not used to obtain food. It is a method used to catch fish for the aquarium trade. When threatened by people, the typical reef fish response is to seek shelter in the coral making them hard to catch. Some people use a solution containing cyanide to squirt in the fishes direction to impair them so that they are then easy to collect. The cyanide pollutes the water and can kill the coral caught in its direction.</p>
  <p>The latter two techniques are illegal but still happen largely due to the financial incentives offered by the market to poor people in developing countries. Trawler fishing is an industrial activity that is more regulated and is banned under many circumstances but still happens all too often.</p>

<h2>Pollution</h2>
<p>In this context, pollution is referring to artificial and detrimental materials being deposited directly into the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Plastic</strong><br> 
Plastic pollution is of particular concern due to the fact that it doesn’t degrade but simply breaks up into micro fragments that can accumulate in the marine food chain. Every year, about 8 million tons of plastic ends up in the ocean. About one million sea birds and 100 thousand marine mammals and turtles die each year by eating or being trapped by plastic. Plastic trash is found in about 90% of seabirds. Current predictions estimate that by 2050, there could be more plastic in the sea than fish if plastic pollution carries on at its current rate.</p>

  <p><strong>Chemical Run-Off</strong><br>
Sewage runoff and fertilizers from the land leach into rivers which flow into the sea. These disrupt the chemical composition of the water. Their effects include an increase in rates of diseases among reef organisms and an increase in algal blooms due to the excess nutrients.</p>

  <p><strong>Oil Spills</strong><br>
A single large oil spill can kill creatures in the thousands. In 2010, a particularly large oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico caused by the company BP killed an estimated 82 thousand birds, 6 thousand turtles and over 25 thousand marine mammals.</p>

<h2>Coral Bleaching</h2>
<p>Coral has a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic zooxanthellae. In addition to being important for supplying the coral with nutrients, zooxanthellae is what makes coral so colourful. If the temperature gets unsuitably high for 3 to 4 weeks, the stress response of the coral is to expel its zooxanthellae. When this happens the coral looses its colour so the coral turns white. During this period the coral will not obtain the nutrient gains from photosynthetic activity. Bleaching is a natural phenomenon that corals are capable of recovering from. However, if the temperature gets too high or the coral is bleached for too long it will die.</p>

<h2>Mangrove Deforestation</h2>
<p>More than 35% of the world’s mangroves have been lost since 1980. Reasons for mangrove deforestation include timber, fuel wood, clearance for agriculture and aquaculture or even just clearance for a better beach view for tourists. When mangroves are lost, the important functions they provide for reef ecosystems are lost with them. These include a substantial reduction in fish recruitment due to the loss of their nursery grounds. It also includes increased sedimentation on the reef because the mangroves were locking in a lot of the fine sediment. Destroying mangroves also reduces coastal protection from storms, erosion and tsunamis.</p>

  <div style="border: solid 2px gray; padding: 0px 35px 10px 35px;">
<h2>Coral Diseases</h2>
<p>Like any organism, corals are susceptible to diseases. Coral diseases are typically highly recognizable as prominent white, black or red bands around the coral structure. One particularly severe case is the outbreak of white band disease that spread throughout colonies of staghorn coral (Acropora cervicornis) in the 1980s. Throughout this pandemic, an estimated 80-90% of staghorn coral declined in the Caribbean and Western Atlantic. Although coral diseases are perfectly natural, the weakening of coral health and reduction in genetic diversity caused by anthropogenic influence makes coral more susceptible to disease contagion and severity.</p>

<h2>Disruptive Species Outbreaks</h2>
<p>Anthropogenic activity influences the shift in dominance of species. When certain species become to dominant on a reef, it can be at the expense of the biodiversity and therefore health of the ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Crown of Thorns Starfish (Australia)</strong><br>
Crown of thorns starfish are native to Australian waters, however in recent decades the Great Barrier Reef has suffered from huge populations that tend to boom every 15 to 17 years. These starfish graze on much of the reef, doing much damage to the benthos and reducing resources available for other species. Scientists have linked these population booms with pollution. The pollution causes a nutrient overload in the water, and this nutrient overload is triggering an increase in the spawning of juveniles.</p>

  <p><strong>The Lionfish Invasion (The Caribbean)</strong><br>
Lionfish are native to the Indo-Pacific, where they are not a problem. However, they somehow got released in Caribbean waters in the 1980s (the exact details of how are disputed). By 2014, lionfish had spread down to Venezuela and all the way up to Rhode Island (USA). They have even been found around New York, although here the temperature is too low for them to reproduce. Lionfish are able to survive very well in the Caribbean because the local fauna have not learnt to recognize them as prey. Lionfish are not fussy eaters so have no trouble finding food and are eating up much of the wildlife on the reef. They have an extremely high reproductive output (females produce up to two million eggs per year!) They can also thrive in a large depth range, being found in the top meter of the sea, down to about 90 meters.</p>

<h2>Phase Shift</h2>
<p>It is important to recognize that neither the drivers nor the consequences of the threats to coral reefs work in isolation. Coral reef ecology is a highly intricate system. The weakening of coral by one effect (e.g. global warming) leaves it more vulnerable to damage from another effect (e.g. an increase in storms). Fish and coral are heavily dependent upon one another. Removing too many fish from a reef means less algae is grazed upon. This causes an increase in algal growth which causes a reduction in coral. This means less habitat for fish which further decreases the fish population, which further increases algal growth, and so a ‘positive feedback cycle’ is formed. The end result is what is referred to as an ecological ‘phase shift’. This is a significant shift in the type of biological community, in this case, a shift from a highly complex and diverse coral dominated system, to a algae dominated community with less structural complexity and a greatly reduced quantity of fish. This makes restoring coral reefs incredibly challenging. It is far harder to reverse a phase shift than avoid it.</p>
